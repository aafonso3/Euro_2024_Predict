We employed web scraping techniques utilizing BeautifulSoup to gather historical and current data on teams and players directly from Wikipedia. This ensures our predictions are based on the most relevant and up-to-date information.

Prediction Model
The core of our predictive engine is the Poisson method, renowned for its effectiveness in predicting sports outcomes. This statistical model calculates the probability of discrete events, like the number of goals scored, helping us determine the likely winners of each match.
